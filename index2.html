        <p>The Aberdare Country Club, onlyThe Aberdare Country Club, only a three-hour drive northeast from Nairobi, is nestled on a slope of Mweiga Hill in the Aberdare Highlands, part of the Great Rift Valley. This captivating site was selected by an English couple who had decided to settle in the land of their choosing - Kenya. It all happened many years ago; their children grew up there, but then moved on to different places. After almost half a century, their home, "The Steep", was sold and re-named "The Aberdare Country Club".The Aberdare Country Club, only a three-hour drive northeast from Nairobi, is nestled on a slope of Mweiga Hill in the Aberdare Highlands, part of the Great Rift Valley.

    <p>The furniture is old and worn, and dated (at a guess the 1950â€™s). Trims on the counters in the bathroom. Showers leak all over the floor. Think this why there are lots of millipedes that come out at night. Beds are very squeaky and mattresses are obviously old. Linen has seen better days id.</p>
